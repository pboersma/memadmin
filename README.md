## Optimizations
This project uses industry-standard design patterns to improve the **scalability, maintainability, and testability** of the application. The patterns are categorized as follows:

### **üèõ Architectural Patterns**

#### **Dependency Injection**
**Used in:** Controllers & Services  

**Purpose:**  
- Decouples components by injecting dependencies.  
- Improves testability by allowing mocks.

#### **Service Pattern**
**Used in:** Business Logic Layer  

**Purpose:**  
- Keeps controllers thin by moving business logic into services.  
- Improves code reusability across different parts of the application.

### **üõ† Creational Patterns**

#### **Singleton Pattern**
**Used in:** Database Connection Manager  

**Purpose:**  
- Ensures only one database connection instance is created.  
- Improves performance by reusing the connection.

### **üèó Structural Patterns**

#### **Repository Pattern**
**Used in:** Data Access Layer  

**Purpose:**  
- Decouples business logic from database access.  
- Allows switching between **Eloquent, raw SQL, or PDO** without modifying core logic.
